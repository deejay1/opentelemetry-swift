/// All spans reported by the SDK implementation are first added to a synchronized queue (with a
/// maxQueueSize maximum size, after the size is reached spans are dropped) and exported
/// every scheduleDelayMillis to the exporter pipeline in batches of maxExportBatchSize.
/// If the queue gets half full a preemptive notification is sent to the worker thread that
/// exports the spans to wake up and start a new export cycle.
/// This batchSpanProcessor can cause high contention in a very high traffic service.
